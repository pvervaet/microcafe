# Micro Cafe
Sample code to show microservices using NET, in the context of a cafe

Code should be used for inspiration, not duplication.

The code here is currently a work in progress. The admin microservice is functional, but the cashier and barista services are not finished and don't compile. I'm happy to take a pull request :-)

##Slides

If you're interested in the slides related to this code, [they're on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/rbanks54/architecting-microservices-in-net)

P.S. I'm hacking around with making a .NET Core, Dockerised version of this sample code as well. Stay tuned (or submit a pull request if you can't wait for it) 

Project to be updated...
